# HAC_introduction
HAC is a personal learning repository focused on exploring the world of hardware acceleration using tools like NVIDIA CUDA and High-Level Synthesis (HLS). It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with parallel computing, performance optimization, and low-level hardware interaction‚Äîfrom GPUs to FPGAs.

Nsight Systems Analyse (Jetson Nano)
De performantieanalyse met Nsight Systems toont aan dat de grootste bottleneck zich bevindt in de functie cudaMemcpyToSymbol, goed voor 87% van de totale CUDA API-tijd (¬±518 ms voor 2 oproepen). Daarnaast veroorzaakt sem_timedwait 72% van de OS-runtime tijd, wat wijst op aanzienlijke CPU-wachttijden. De eigenlijke CUDA-kernels (row/column convoluties) zijn effici√´nt met gemiddelde looptijden onder 3 ms.
üõ†Ô∏è Optimalisatiesuggesties: vermijd blocking API-calls en vervang cudaMemcpyToSymbol door asynchrone geheugenoverdracht (cudaMemcpyAsync) waar mogelijk.
